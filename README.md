# Luiza's website
This website was made with the purposes of education and learning HTML and CSS. The learning objectives were the following:

1. demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the most basic skills required to create
and design websites
2. demonstrate a basic understanding and implementation of digital image editing (e.g.
adjust, enhance, optimize etc.)
3. demonstrate a basic understanding and implementation of web usability, i.e. being able
to analyze and report userfriendliness of websites


<b> Feel free to cruise around, play with the interactive features I added and get to know me a little bit. The website is purely experiemntal and made with the main objective of having fun while learning </b>
