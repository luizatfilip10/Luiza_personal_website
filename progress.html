     <h2>Week 1</h2>
     <p> I learned how to create my own website, where i had to incorporate a homepage, a page about me, a page about my hobbies and another one about my studies. Had to link these pages through <b>HYPERLINKS</b></p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Week 2</h2>
     <p> Next assignment was all about <b>STYLESHEETS</b>. We first created an external stylesheet where we had to include DIV elements. On the main page (index) page I included an element class for each of the three pages (aboutme, hobbies, education) such as "div class = "myhobbies"" which consequently was able to be modified through  the <b>style.css</b>. I even tried to put a gif as a background image</p>
    <hr>
     <h2>Week 3</h2>
     <p> This week we learned how to create image maps, meaning that when you hover over a particular part of the image and click it, it takes you to a link. We had to include three links in the <b>IMAGE MAPS</b>: mouth for food; eyes for movies and ears for music. Prior to this,we needed a smaller version of the imag ewe use for the image map in order to create a thumbnail. </p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Week 4</h2>
     <p> This week's assignment was all about creating a new page that is about "mini banana waffles". We could include the page anywhere and the goal was to combine everything we ahve been doing until now together into a new page. We have also learned how to use the function "alt" for images </p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Week 5</h2>
     <p> The requirenments of the website had to be that it needs to include a container of max 800px and the text had to be no more then 545px. Added a naviagtion bar with the necessary requirenmnets</p>
     <hr>
     <h2>Week 6</h2>
     <p>This last week was all about making improvenments and adjustments to the website, plus aslo including a Web Usability Review of one of my classmates websites (Linyu) by answering some provided questions. </p>
