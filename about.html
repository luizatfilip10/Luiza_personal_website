     <h2>Me, myself and I</h2>
     <p> My name is Luiza Filip and I am a 19 year old second year bachelor student in the bachelor of Communication and Information Science at University of Groningen. I was born in Romania, but at 13 I moved to Spain to continue my education. I graduated from IB and at 18 I moved to the Netherlands for university</p>

        <h2>Vibes </h2>
        <p>I tend to dress in the way I want to be perceived, so my whole wardrobe consists of black attire and silver jewelery. Once a friend of a friend commented that my vibe is the same as the black 8ball and that might be my favourite compliment I ever got. My goal in life is to be perceived as a black cat, as they tend to be dark and mysterious, but due to my undenying love to talk, my friends tell me I am more of an orange cat. I like to ignore those comments and live a life of blissfull ignorance. </p>

        <h2>Accessories </h2>
        <p>My love to accesorize my sims character is undying, any piece of silver (or rather stainless steel as it tends to be cheaper) jewelery has to be in my possesion and therefore it is. Piercings are also an addiction I do not intend to sober up from yet</p>
