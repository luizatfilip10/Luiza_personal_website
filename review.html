        <center><h2> Reviewing <u><a href="https://siegfried.webhosting.rug.nl/~s4384261/index.html"> Linyu Li's</a></u> website </h2></center>
        <p><b><li>Scannability</b></li>
               <p>The website presents <b> visual hierarchy</b> in terms of content, as it has a structure with titles, subtitles and text, however there is a lot going on in terms of colors. Linyu highlights the titles with big text and a different color from the background therefore the most improtant aspect of the page is distinctive. There are a few hyperlinks that are obviously clickable. There is quite a lot of design noise due to the different colors that aren't necessarily going together, therefore potentially distracting the viewer from the actual content of the website.
                <p><img src="hierarchy.jpg" width="540"></p>
        <p><b><li>Text</b></li>
               <p>The text is easy to follow, and Linyu makes use of <b>bullet points</b> and <b>lists</b> which eases the eye to follow the text. 
        <p><b><li>Happy Talk </b></li>
               <p>The text poseses a happy and joyful <b>tone</b> and there isn't so much text that it would have the reader bored. 
        <p><b><li>Navigation</b></li>
               <p>Althought the <b>navigation</b> is always in the same spot, there is a difference between the navigation bar displayed on the homepage comparing to the one that is displayed on the other pages so there is a lack of consistency. 
                <p><img src="nav1.jpg" width="540"></p>
                <p><img src="nav2.jpg" width="540"></p>
                <p> There is a link to the homepage visible in each page, but it is not included in the navigaiton bar alongside the other ones. There is also a lack of "you are here" indication, even though he did include hovering over the navigation items. 
        <p><b><li>Homepage</b></li>
               <p> The <b>homepage</b> clearly portrays what the website is about, as it includes a small introduction about himself.
        <p><b><li>Possible improvements</b></li>
                <p><ol><li>Altough it is clearly noticeble that a container exists, I would make the "content" that includes the text smaller then the width of the container (790px) and add a margin between the white backround and the start of the text, to avoid those two being very stuck together</li>
                <li>Maybe a more color coordinated display would be easier to follow to the eye and not so distracting</li>
                <li>We can see he has used the thumbnail to link it to a page that shows his favourite things, however it is not noticable to any other reader that would not know to look for it, so I'd strongly suggest including a little text such as "click here" and "press on my mouth to find out what i like to eat" in orde to have the visitor interact iwth the website witht he help of a guide. </li>
